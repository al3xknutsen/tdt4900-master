# TDT4900 Master's Thesis NTNU

Code for my Master's Thesis in Computer Science, June 2022

## Requirements

The code is written with Python 3.7. Most Python packages are listed in requirements.txt. In addition, two unofficial libraries were used, namely GDAL and rasterio, from here: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/

Most of the code needs code from NVIDIA Omniverse in order to function: https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-omniverse-platform
In the launcher, find the "Connect Sample Omniverse Connector" and follow the instructions for installation.
Replace run_py_sample.bat with the one in this repo. Also, move all .py files out of their folders, and place them in the source/pyHelloWorld folder in the dummy connector.

NOTE! The code probably will not run out of the box. File paths have been anonymized, and file dependencies like height maps and orthophotos have not been uploaded due to copyright laws.
